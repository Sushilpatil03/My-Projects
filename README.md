## 1) Project Personality traits :-

"Conducted a statistical study comparing personality traits of NCC and Non-NCC students using the Big Five model. Applied t-tests and Run tests through SPSS to analyze gender and group differences, concluding no significant variation in personality traits."


## 2) Project Bivariate Extreme Value Distribution :-

"This project explores the theoretical development and practical implementation of Bivariate Extreme Value Distributions (BEVDs) for modeling simultaneous extreme events across multiple variables. It utilizes R-based simulations and real-world datasets—such as rainfall-river discharge and temperature-electricity demand—to evaluate parametric and non-parametric estimation techniques like Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Pickands estimators."
